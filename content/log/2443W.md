what i'm missing is the decisive moment. out of habit or fear of the camera being slow and missing the shot i wait for held gestures, but held geatures aren't alive, they are statue-like, still, dead.

the few really good shots i have are alive moments, really split seconds in time. in these the gesture is moving, ongoing, isn't held for a beat, i just catch it at the right point in its arch.

that's the decisive moment.
