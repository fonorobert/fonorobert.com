There are very few things that are more annoying than finally figuring out the solution to a work problem and then not having the time to implement it. Landing on a well thought-out, perfect plan makes me excited and gives me an energy boost so that I can't wait to go and implement things, to see the plan realized. And then BAM it's time to walk the dog or BAM you have a meeting or BAM something external, something must-do, something I would even like otherwise, but no, now all I can think about is the perfect bliss of "ready to go" slipping away.
