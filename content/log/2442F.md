Yesterday was a messy day. It started out great but devolved into ADHD fuelled chaos and unintended mobile gaming as the day progressed.
It's hard not hating yourself when you feel like you messed things up for your self. But today is a new day.

Working through the Svelte tutorial, so I'll make some notes on new JS concepcts I'm learning.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

ARROW FUNCTIONS - *Intended as a simpler/shorter way to declare small functions.*

Syntax:

```JavaScript
const varname = () => statement;
//vs
const varname = function() { statement };

const varname = (a, b) => a + b;
//vs
const varname = function(a, b) { return a + b };
```

Features:
- implicit return - if only a single statement, it automatically returns it's result
- no `this`

In Svelte it's customary to use these, so better get used to it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

REACTIVITY ON ASSIGNMENT - *Reactive DOM changes are triggered on value assignment.*

Using JS methods like `.push` doesn't trigger it, so needs sg like a self assignment after.

```JavaScript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4); //this didn't trigger reactive DOM update!
numbers = numbers; //thid did
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

KEYED EACH - *use a unique id for each object in an array of object, use that in each block ALWAYS*

Not super clear on underlying issue, something about the underlying `Map` Svelte manipulates for the `each` block. 
Either way, the safe way to do an `each` is:)

```JavaScript
let things = [
	{id: 1, name: "apple"}
];

//then in DOM rendering:
{#each things as thing (thing.id)}
```
(The things objects need to each have a unique id)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

TWO-WAY BINDING - *let changes in value from child element/component update value in parent*

Normally `<input value={name} />` means editing the input's value doesn't update `name`. However `<input bind:value={name} />` makes it two-way, so editing `value` in the input changes `name`.

This should work for components, too, so I can share a value between the parent and child and both can modify it.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

CONDITIONAL OPERATOR - *a `?` to act as a shortened `if` for assignments*

for simple `if` statemens:

```JavaScript
let result = condition ? valueIfTruthy : valueIfNotTruthy;
```

A different topic from today: 

HOW TO STRUCTURE MY PHOTO ARCHIVE?

My basic folder structure is pretty clear, I have yearly folders, within those I have folders by area/topic and within those I usually have dated folders for "sessions".

It looks kinda like this:

```
2024
	Trips 2024
		2024-04-10_15 Lisbon
		...
	Journal 2024
		w01 2024-01-01_06
		w02 2024-01-06_12
		...
	Projects 2024
		Climate garden 2024
			2024-09-10 compost workshop
			...
	Street 2024
		2024-03-11 street session Budapest downtown
		...
```

This works pretty well for sessions, trips, etc., things that are clearly defined (ie. I went out to shoot for a specific project or had a well defined personal event). For anything that's not a clear "session" I use the Journal. Here I have weekly folders, and all the personal, home life, random, etc. pictures from that week live there.

It's important for me to have a folder based structure. I use Lightroom currently, but I want to make sure that my organization system stays usable even if I want to switch to a different software down the road. I also want to make sure that my structure stays intact for many years in case I need to manage my archive without any proprietary software at some point.

My current problem is this: I have a few projects that I don't explicitely shoot for. Rather, they are overarching projects that I build from street photography as well as shots from my daily life, other projects, etc.

So I need to find a way to have all the photos I take still stay in their "source" folders, but also have some structure for collecting some of them under these "collection" type projects.

Another issue I have is that while I'm pretty structured about the RAW files, I don't have a good system for culling, rating, editing them and I don't have a system for storing edited "positives" (ie. exported JPEGs) in a similarly structured way. *(the same problem of the collection projects applies to the JPEGs as well)*

So I need to think about two things:
- what routine/system to set up for methodically processing my photos after they are in my archive?
	*including doing exports of every folder's top selects and storing those in a structured way*
- how to manage collections of selected photos (either for a project or just as portfolio/best of collections)?
	*both RAWs in Lightroom and exported "positive" JPEGs that are the final output for me*

This needs some further thought, but the trick is to not overthink it, which I tend to do. I feel there must be a straightforward answer to both questions, I just haven't found it yet.
