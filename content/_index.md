You can contact me about projects, comissions or snapshots of cute dogs at [robert@fonorobert.com](mailto:robert@fonorobert.com).

I have a portraiture portfolio [here](#).

I am a member of the Hungarian Association of Journalists (MÃšOSZ). Not sure how relevant that is, but I find it cool.

I keep a semi-regular log at [fono.day](https://fono.day).
