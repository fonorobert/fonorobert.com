Tisza Party, led by Péter Magyar, has built itself up to be a new political movement in 2024. The party aims to position itself as an alternative to the current government and regime. The party has used mass demonstrations and commemorations of national holidays as well as well known symbols lifted from the ruling Fidesz party to build its base. Tisza draws in supporters of varied ages and demographies, held together by the person and personality of Péter Magyar, the party's founder and leader. This report looks at three large demonstrations of Tisza Party to examine the movement that aims to blend the politics of past and present.
