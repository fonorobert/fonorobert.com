Mayday, traditionally a holiday to celebrate workers, has lost a lot of its political connotations in Hungary. All that remains is a general sense of celebration and filling onself up to the brim with basic forms of enjoyment. City Park (VÃ¡rosliget) in Budapest is the traditional location where the folk of the city gather to (mostly) eat and drink.
