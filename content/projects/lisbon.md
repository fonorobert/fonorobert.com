Lisbon is, as all tourist destinations, covered in a shroud of tourist attractions and carefully orchestrated experiences. As one person in the mass of tourists I stand little chance at gaining real insight into the city’s true nature. Reality does poke out from time to time however, allowing me fleeting glimpses at the city beneath the layer intended for visitors like myself.

I can’t claim to have a true accounting of Lisbon, nor an analysis of the tension between its “real” and “fake” faces. Instead, this is a subjective look at Lisbon’s human and visual rythms, as viewed from a personal perspective.
Ultimately, all I have is the feeling I sit with and nurture on the flight back home.
