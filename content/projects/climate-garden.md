On a corner in the 8th district of Budapest, among the old tenement buildings typical of the neighbourhood, we find an area reminiscent of a forest, covered with trees and thick vegetation. This is “Aurora Climate Garden”, a project started in 2020 on a vacant lot previously used as a parking lot. The originator and main caretaker of the garden is an American, Mark Richards. He aimed to create a self-sustaining, forest-like ecosystem as a climate strategy. This green area is intended to sequester atmospheric carbon in the plants and soil as well as to cool the air directly, counteracting the urban heat island effect of the city.

In place of planned planting and pruning, Mark focuses on improving the soil and the general environment of the garden. He believes the trees will find their natural balance with each other and even plants that others might consider weeds can improve and strengthen the ecosystem of the garden.

My project aims to document the operation and methods of the Climate Garden, as well as its impact on its immediate environment. Starting in spring 2024 I plan to document a complete season of the garden, its development, the work of its caretakers and the change of the seasons in this miniature urban forest. Through this project I want to explore the possibilities the Climate Garden presents as a template for climate action combatting urban heating.
