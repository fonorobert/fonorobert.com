In the 8th district of Budapest, on the corner of Auróra street and Bérkocsis street passers by will find a wooded lot instead of the old tenement buildings typical of the area. This is Aurora Climate Garden. The volunteers of the garden, led by an American, Mark Richards, are working to create a self-sustaining forest ecosystem. They use household compost to enrich the soil of the 240 square meter lot.  
The once barren location is now covered by trees, bushes and a variety of undergrowth. The multi-layered, forest-like flora and the high quality, living soil can store more water, provide shade and cool the garden and its surrondings as well. The garden is also home to community events and workshops. The Climate Garden serves as direct climate action, natural environment and community space all at once.

"2024/24-klimakert/FonoRobert-klimakert-5.jpg :: The garden also plays host to community events organized by the Aurora Community Hub next door. It's an especially favored location in the summer months, when the cooling effects of the trees is most needed."
"2024/24-klimakert/FonoRobert-klimakert-6.jpg :: People from the neighborhood as well as visitors to the garden and Aurora Hub regularly bring their household green waste to the garden. The compost created from this waste serves to further enrich the soil of the garden with more and more nutrients."
